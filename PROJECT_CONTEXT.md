## ⚠️ Critical Rules for AI Generation

> [!CAUTION]
> **Never make the site look like a template.** Break the grid. Use asymmetry.

> [!CAUTION]
> **Never use "Dark Mode" as the primary theme.** It must look like paper.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Always mix fonts**: Serif for headers, Mono for details.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Tone Check**: If it sounds like a sales pitch ("Unlock your potential!"), delete it. It should sound like advice ("Here is where I lost money").
